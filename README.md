# Linux-Shell Scripting Project
Shell Scripting Project – Data Preprocessing

 Bash Dataset Preprocessing Tool
This project is an interactive Bash-based preprocessing tool designed to perform essential data preparation tasks directly from the terminal. It enables users to:

 Load datasets (CSV-like format using ; as delimiter)

 Display feature (column) names

Apply Label Encoding for categorical features

Perform One-Hot Encoding

Apply Min-Max Scaling for numerical data

 Save the processed dataset

 Built-in error handling for file existence, readability, and format validation

Key Features:

Fully interactive command-line interface

Uses associative arrays (hashmaps) for mapping categorical data

Supports Min-Max normalization for numeric columns

Outputs intermediate steps and results in separate files (final.txt, scale.txt, etc.)

🛠 Use case: Useful for basic preprocessing tasks in machine learning or data analysis pipelines when working in shell environments without Python or external libraries.
